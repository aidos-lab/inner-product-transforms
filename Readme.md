# Topological Reconstruction and Interpolation of Graphs and Point Clouds

The Euler Characteristic Transform is an expressive and fast to compute. 
However inversion of Euler Characteristic Transforms has hitherto only
focussed on specialized cases, such as grayscale images and theoretical 
treatises for graphs in 2D.

However, computational difficulties have any effective algorithms to be 
developed for the inversion of graphs in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
We present an efficient inverse algorithm for the inversion of Euler 
Characteristic Transforms for graphs in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

Since the ECT is only injective one can not expect an inverse to exist
for arbitrary "images", only in case where the ect is known to be an ECT of a 
graph.
